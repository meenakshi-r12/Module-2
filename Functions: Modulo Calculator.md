# Ex-2B Functions

## Aim
To write a Python Program and display the mean of three floating-point numbers provided by the user
## Algorithm
Define a function "result(a, b, c)" to calculate the mean:
   a. Compute the mean as "(a + b + c) / 3" and store it in the variable "mean".
   b. Print the mean in the format: "mean is {mean}".
   
2. Read three floating-point numbers from the user:
   a. Read the first number and store it in variable "a".
   b. Read the second number and store it in variable "b".
   c. Read the third number and store it in variable "c".

3. Call the function "result(a, b, c)" with the three input values.

4. End of the program.
## PROGRAM:
```
def result(a,b,c):
    mean = (a+b+c)/3
    print(f"mean is {mean}")
a = float(input())
b = float(input())
c=float(input()) 
```

## Result
Thus, the required program is written and executed successfully.
