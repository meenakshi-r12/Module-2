# Ex-2C Built-In Funtions & Lambda Function

## Aim
To write a lambda function which takes z as a parameter and returns z*56 using python.
## Algorithm
. Define a lambda function "multiply_by_56" to multiply a number by 56:
   a. The lambda function takes one argument "z".
   b. Returns the value of "z * 56".
2. Read an integer input from the user and store it in the variable "z".
3. Call the lambda function "multiply_by_56(z)" with the input value "z" and store the result in the variable "result".
4. Print the value of "result".
5.	End of the program.
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
multiply_by_56 = lambda z: z * 56
z = int(input())
result = multiply_by_56(z)
print(result)
```
